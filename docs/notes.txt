// React Query //

- libraly used to help with sending http request and help keeping the frontend UI in sync with the data from the backend.

// NOTE//
- it does not send the http request/ you will have to write the code that send the request
- tanstack query will handle data, error, loading, caching and more.

// NOTES:: //
 - Inorder to use the react query provided features, you must wrap the component that is going to use these features with the provided features frm the react query.
 - The caching of image is done by the browser and react and react query has nothing to do with it
 - by using dynamic query key, react query will can cache the and reuse the different data keys based on the same query.
